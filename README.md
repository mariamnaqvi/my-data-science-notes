git remote -v will show where the remote is pointing to

you cannot commit to github without a msg

If you make a folder locally, and then move into that folder and run git clone a repo will be created for you, so don’t make the directory locally first. Just navigate into the directory (the one that is serving as your container for repos and not a repo itself) and run git clone codecodecode there and then you can navigate down into your new repo.

any folder on your computer can be a git repo but you have to get into it using git init

reading labels for commits will show you which one you want to go back to. best to go to the last working version instead of starting from scratch

git push -u origin master <<< only first push requires this. push is an upload clone is a download

git clone link to copy  <<<< allows u to download an online git repo to your computernavigate in your terminal to where you want to download the file first then do git clone
